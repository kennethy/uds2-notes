## Chapter 12. Transactions

### 12.1 ACID
- A set of guarantees or properties the database will provide
- Atomicity: partial failures are not possible. Either all the changes have been applied or not are applied.
- Consistency: a responsibility that falls on the application layer that defines the correctness of the database. A transaction only transitions a database from a correctness state to another correct state.
- Isolation: concurrent transactions does not lead to race conditions.
- Durability: changes are persisted on durable storage once the updates are committed.

### 12.2 Isolation level
- Dirty write: when a transaction overwrites a write that has been made by another transaction that has yet to be committed.
- Dirty read: when a transaction observes a write from a transaction that has not completed yet.
- Fuzzy read: when a transaction observes inconsistent values on different reads (value updated by other transactions between the different reads).
- Phandom read: when a transaction reads a group of objects matching a specific condition, while another transaction concurrently updates the objects matching the same condition, leading to an incorrect value at commit time (transaction A calculating the sum of employees' salaries while another transaction B modifies/deletes some employees).
- An isoloation level protects against race conditions like some of the mentioned above. An isolation level defines the type of race conditions it forbids.
  - read uncommitted: forbids dirty writes
  - read committed: forbids dirty reads
  - repeatable reads: forbids fuzzy reads
  - serializable: forbids phantom reads
- Serializability guarantees that executing a group of transactions has the same effect of running them serially (in sequence).
- Strict serializability: serializability with the additional requirement that changes are immediately visible to all future transactions. It is slow as it requires consensus.

### 12.2.1 Concurrency control
- The concurrency control protocol: there are two categories of protocols that guaratanee serializability: pessimistic and optimistic.
- A pessimistic protocol uses locks to block other transactions from accessing an object.
  - Two-phase-locking (2PL): supports read lock and write lock.
    - Read lock is shared by multiple transactions that can access the object in read-only mode. It blocks transactions from acquiring a write lock.
    - A write lock is owned by a single transaction only. Other transactions will be blocked until the write lock is released.
    - Lock manager holds the locks until they are acquired by the transactions, keep tracks of who are currently holding the locks.
    - First phase is the expanding phase, in which only lock acquisitions are allowed.
    - Second phase is the shrinking phase, in whcih only lock releases are allowed.
    - Strict serializability is guaranteed if the above rules are followed.
    - In practice, locks are only released when a transaction completes. This prevents wasted work.
    - 2PL is prone to deadlocks; a general approach is to abort a "victim" transaction and restart to break the deadlock.
  - An optimistic protocol does not block based on the assumption that conflicts are rare and transactions are short-lived.
    - Optimistic concurrency control (OCC): a transaction writes to a local workspace without modifying the actual data. At commit time, the data store compares the tranasction's workspace to see if it conflicts with the workspace of another transaction.
    - A timestamp is assigned to each transaction that determines its serialzability order. The transaction's local workspace is copied to the data store if the validation exceeds. Otherwise, the transaction is aborted and restarted.
  - Optimistic protocols are well suited for read-heavy workload as it does not have the overlead of lock management, whereas pessimistic protocols are suited for conflict-heacy workloads since they avoid wasting work.
- Multi-version concurrency control (MVCC): when a transaction writes an object, the data store keeps track of the versions, and when a transaction reads an object, it reads the newest version that existed when the transaction started. This allows a read-only transaction to read an immutable and consistent snapshot of the data store without blocking others. It fallbacks to using 2PL or OCC for a transaction that perform writes.

### 12.3 Atomicity
- The data store needs to ensure to rollback the changes when a transaction fails or aborted.
- The data store records all changes to the write-ahead log (WAL) on disk before applying them. Each log entry keeps track of the old value and the new value, as well as the identifier of the transaction that made the update.
- The log is only read if a transaction is aborted or the data store crashes.

### 12.3.1 Two-phase commit
- Two-phase commit is used to implement atomic transaction across processes. It has a prepare phase and a commit phase.
- The coordinator sends a `prepare` request to all participants whether they are prepared to commit the transaction.
- If all the participants replied that they are ready, the coordinator will send another `commit` request to all of  them.
- If any of the processes replies that they are not ready, the coordinator will send an `abort` request to all participants again.
- If a participant replies that it is ready, it must do so later on no matter what. It cannot proceed further until it receivers a `commit` or `abort` request.
- If the coordinator decides to commit or abort, it cannot changes it mind.
- 2PC could be slow as it needs to wait for a response from all participants.
- If the coordinator fails, all participants are stuck.
