## 16.Partitioning
- When the data has grown to a point that it can no longer fit onto a single machine, it has to be splitted into smaller partitions (or shards) to stored on separate nodes.
- A gateway service (reverse proxy) is in charge of mapping the partition to the corresponding node that stores it.
- Partitioning introduces some complexities:
  - A gateway service is needed to determine which partition a node is responsible for.
  - Multiple partitions have to be aggregated to pull up data across partitions (like a group by).
  - Adding/removing partitions at runtime requires moving data across nodes.
- There are two main ways to map a partition to a node: range partitioning and hash partitioning.

### 16.1 Range partitioning
- Data is split into lexicographically sorted partitions (e.g. A-H, I-P, Q-Z).
- If the distribution of keys is more or less uniform, then the key range can be splitted evenly.
- Can lead to hotspot problems if certain keys are accessed more frequently than others
- Rebalancing occurs when nodes are added or removed due to system's load.
- Static partitioning: when creating more partitions than neccessary when the system is first initialized.
  - Drawback: number of partitions is fixed and may not be cost effective.
- Dynamic partitioning: partitions are created on demand.
  - Two adjacent partitions can be merged when both of them become "cold".

### 16.2 Hash partitioning
- A hash function is used to map a key to a random number within a certain range.
  - This ensures the keys' hashes are distributed uniformly across the range.
- A subset of the hashes will be assigned to each partition.
  - One simple way is to take the modulo of a hash: `hash(key) mod N`.
  - Can be problematic when a new partition is added, since most keys have to be moved or shuffled.
    - Shuffling can be expensive.
- Consistently hashing randomly maps both the partition identifiers and keys onto a circle, and each key is assigned to the closest partition that appears on the circle in clockwise order.
  - At most K/N keys will be moved, where K is the number of keys and N is the number of partitions.
  - Main drawback: sort order over the partition is lost, which is required to efficiently scan all the data in order.
