## 22. Control planes and data planes
- API gateways should favor availability over consistency when routing requests to internal services. It should prefer consistency over availability for requests sent to management endpoints (configurations).
  - It should be split into data planes and control planes.
  - Control plane: configuration related concerns.
  - Data plane: internal service related concerns. The critical path for functionalities.
- Data should be robust to withstand control plane failures. A data plane is said to have a hard dependency on the control plane if it can no longer serve requests when the control plane is down.
  - The theoreticl availability of the system is the product of the availabilities of its components.
  - Static stability: when the data plane continues to run with a stale configuration when the control plane is temporarily unavailable.

### 22.1 Scale imbalance
- Generally, data plane has a heavier load than data plane, and thus there's a risk of it overloading the control plane.
  - For example, on data plane restart, the configuration has to be fetched from the control plane.
  - One approach is to use a buffer between the control plane and the data plane.
    - The control plane periodically dumps its state to the file store regardless of whether it changed.
    - The data plane periodically reads the state from the buffer.
    - The additional component leads to higher latency and weakens consistency guarantees.
  - Seconda approach is to have the control plane to push the configuration to the data plane.
    - To reduce latency, the control plane version controls the changes and only pushes the delta.
    - An intermediate data store that contains a recent snapshot of the control plane's state can be used.

### 22.2 Control theory
- In control theory, a controller monitors a dynamic system, compares it to the desired state, and applies a corrective action to drive the system closer to the the desired state.
- In addition to pushing configuration to the data plane, it should also monitor whether the configuration has actually been applied within a reasonable amount of time.
- Use CI/CD pipeline for incrementally releasing a new version of the service.
