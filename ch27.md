## 27. Downstream resiliency
  
### 27.1 Timeout
- Timeout helps to detect connectivity issues and stop them from cascading from one component to another.
- `XMLHTTPRequest` in Javascript uses the default timeout of zero. `fetch` is a modern replacement of it.
- Rule of thumb: always set timeout when making network calls, and be wary of third-party libraries that don't expose settings for timeouts.
- Timeout value could be based off p99 of the downstream service's response time.
- Ideally, we should be able to monitor the entire life cycle of a network call.
  - Duration of the call
  - Status code received
  - Whether a timeout is triggered
- A reverse proxy that is co-located on the same machine could also be used. It intercepts remote calls, and the proxy can enforce timeouts and monitor calls.

### 27.2 Retry
- When a timeout occurrs, the system either fails fast or retries.
- For short-lived connectivity issues, a retry has a high probability of success after some backoff time.
- If the downstream service is overwhelmed, retrying right away might further overwhelm the downstream service.

### 27.2.1 Exponential backoff
- A capped exponential function can be used to set a delay between retries.
  - The delay is calculated by multiplying the initial backoff duration by a constant that increases exponentially after each attempt, up to a maximum value.
  - `delay = min(cap, initial-backoff * (2 ^ attempt))`
- Problem: when the downstream service is degraded, clients might simultaneously retry at the same, further degrading it.
  - A random jitter can be used to spread out retries.
  - `delay = random(0, min(cap, initial-backoff * (2 ^ attempt)))` 
- In batch applications that do not have a strict real-time requirements, failed requests can be parked in a retry queue.
- We should consider whether the request is even worth retrying (e.g. failed request fail to unauthorization), or the consequence of retrying it (idempotency).

### 27.2.2 Retry amplification
- Having retries at multiple levels of the dependency could amplify the total number of retries (Service A => Service B => Service C).
- It's recommended to retry at a single level of the chain and fail fast all the others.

### 27.3 Circuit breaker
- For long-term degradations, they can be detected and stopped using the `circuit breaker`.
  - Calls to sub system are temporarily blocked. When the sub-system recovers, the circuit breaker will allow calls to go through again.
- Retries should be considered when the next call is expected to succeed, whereas circuit breakers could be helpful when the next call is expected to fail.
- Implemented using a state machine (open, closed, and half-open state).
  - Close state: pass-through for network calls. Failures and errors are measured. Transitions to the open state if the numbers exceeds the threshold.
  - Open state: network calls would not be attempted and would fail immediately.
  - Half-open: after some time, the circuit breaker allows the next call to pass through. If it succeeds, the circuit breaker transitions back to the closed state. If it fails again, it transitions to the open state.
