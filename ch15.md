## 15. Content delivery network
- A CDN is an overlay network of geographically distributed cacahing servers.
  - It is architected around the design limitations of the network protocols that run the internet.
- When a CDN receives a request, it first checks if the requested resource is cached locally. If not, it would transparently fetches it from the origin server using the original URL. The response is cached and returned to the client.
  - AWS CloudFront and Akamai are examples of such service.

### 15.1 Overlay network
- The public internet is powered by its core routing protocol, BGP, which was not designed with performance in mind.
  - It mainly uses the number of hops to cost how expensive a path is with respect to another, without considering their latencies or congestions.
- CDN is built on top of the internet exploiting a variety of techniques to reduce the response time and increase the bandwith of data transfers.
- Global DNS load balancing allows clients to determine which cluster is closest to them, for the goal of reducing latency.
- CDN are also placed at internet exchange points (where ISPs connet to each other).
- The routing algorithms are optimized to select paths with reduced latencies and congentions, based on the continuously updated data about the health of the network.
  - TCP optimizations like persistent connections are leveraged.

### 15.2 Caching
- A CDN can have multiple content caching layers.
- The top layer is made of edge clusters deployed at different geographical locations.
- A tradeoff must be made between the number of edge clusters and the hit ratio (likelihood of finding an object in the cache).
  - The higher the number of edge clusters, the more geographically dipersed clients are served, and thus lower the cache hit ratio will be.
  - The CDN can have intermediary caching clusters deployed in a smaller number of geographical locations to alleviate this.
