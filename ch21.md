## 21. Microservices
- To mitigate the growing pains of a monnolith application, it can be broken down into a set of independently deployable services that communicate via APIs.
- Each team is free to adopt to the tech stack or hardware they do see fit.
- Rule of thumb: APIs should have a small surface area and encapsulate a significant amount of functionality. Otherwise, it just brings overhead and complexity.

### 21.1. Caveats
- Tech stack: different teams use different tech stacks, this makes it difficult for a developer to move from one team to another.
  - It's recommend to enforce a certain degree of standardization, and provide a good development experience using the recommended portfolios of languages and technologies.
- Communication: remote calls are expensive and introduce non-determinism. Monolith applications might rely on third-party integrations and thus suffer a similar issue, though it's on a much smaller scale.
- Coupling: microservices should be loosely coupled so that a change in one doesn't required a change in others.
- Resource provisioning: it should be simple to provision new machines/data stores/commodity resources. Avoid each team to re-invent the wheel.
- Testing: integration is a lot harder as subtle/unexpected behaviours will only emerge in production scale.
- Operations: there should be a common way of continuously delivering and deploying new builds safely to production.
  - Having good observability is crucial.
- Eventual consistency: data model no longer resides in a single data store. Microservice architecture usually embrace eventual consistency.

### 21.2 API gateway
- API gateway:
  - Context: as clients may perform multiple requests using different services. Having to communicate with each of them can get expensive, especially for mobile clients. Clients also need to know which clients to communicate to. 
  - Solution: hide the internal APIs behind a public one, a revese proxy, for the internal services.

### 21.2.1
- Routing: inbound requests are routed to the corresponding internal services. If the internal endpoint changes,the client can continue to use the public endpoint as if nothing had changed
- Composition: the gateway can offer a high level API that queries multiple services and compress their responses.
  - Data might be inconsistent as updates may not have been propagated to all services. The gateway has to resolve this discrepancy.
- Translation: the gateway can translate from one IPC mechanism to another.
  - It can also expose different APIs for different clients (e.g. more data returned for desktop app with greater screen estate).

### 21.2.2 Cross-cutting concerns
- API gateway being a reverse proxy, it can also implement cross-cutting functionalities like caching, rate lmiting, or authentication/authorization.
  - Authentication: verifying request issuer than it is who it says it is.
  - Authorization: ensuring only allowed operations are performed based on what's configured for the authenticated entity.
  - Sessions are commonly used for authentication and authorization:
    - Client sends credentials to the authentication endpoint, and the application creates a session object with an ID and stores it in-memory or an external data store.
    - The session ID is returned in the response.
    - Future client requests are made with this session ID that allows the application to retrieve the corresponding session object.
  - The API gateway can authenticate external requests, but it's recommended to let internal service to perform check authorizations (to avoid coupling the API gateway with domain logic).
    - A security token is created and passed downstream to the internal services or their dependencies.
    - Opapue: does not contain any information about the entity.
    - Transparent: embed information about the entity to avoid additional calls.
      - Harder to revoke.
    - JSON Web token or API key is commonly used.

### 23.2.3 Caveats
- API gateway is tightly coupled with the internal service APIs.
    - The gateway needs to be updated along with the internal services, which can become a development bottleneck.
