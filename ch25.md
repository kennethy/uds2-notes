## 25. Redundancy
- Redundancy is the main reason why distributed systems can achieve better availability.
- Only some forms of redundancy actually improve availability:
  - The added complexity must not cost more availability than it needs.
  - Reliable health checks on redundant components, so that faulty ones can be taken out of the available pool.
  - The system must be able to run in degraded mode.
  - The system can return to fully redundant mode.
- New servers need to be added to replace the ones that have been removed.

### 25.1 Correlation
- Redundancy is only help if nodes can't fail for the same reason at the same time (failures are not correlated).
- Cloud prividers typically replicate their entire stack in multiple regions.
  - Each region is comprised of multiple data centers/availabilty zones cross connected with high-speed network links.
  - Far enough from each other to minimize correlated failures (like power cuts), but still close enough for low latency.
  - Latency low enough to support synchronous replication protocols.
- Stateful services require the use of replication protocol to keep their state in sync across AZs.
- If a catastrophic event destorys an entire region, the traffics can be distributed to different data centers located in different regions.
  - Global DNS load balancing can be leveraged.
