## 32. Observability
- Set of tools that provides granular insights into a system in production.
- Metrics have high throughput but struggle with high dimensionality.
- Event logs and traces have high dimenstionality but struggle with high throughput.
- Metrics are mainly for monitoring whereas logs and traces are mainly for debugging.


### 32.1 Logs
- Log: immutable list of time elapsed events, typically represented in a bag of key-value pairs using free-form text like JSON or binary format like Protobuf.
- Dumpedt to disk files which are sent by an egent to an external log collector async (e.g. ELK stack/AWS CloudWatch).
- Ingesting, processing, storing massive troves of data could get expensive.
- To make logs useful, all the data about a specific work unit should be stored in a single event. Collating them helps to miniimze the need for joins but doesn't completely eliminate it.
- Every events should include the identifier of the request.
- Have different logging levels.
- Log sampling can help to reduce verbosity.

### 32.2 Traces
- Tracing captures the entire lifespan of a request as it propagtes through the services of the system.
  - It's a list of causally related spans that represent the execution flow of a request into a system.
  - A span represents an internval of time that maps to a logical operation or work unit and contains a bag of key-value pairs.
- A unique trace ID is assigned at the beginning of the request. The trace ID is propagated from one stage to another at every work in the lcoal execution from one thread to another, and from caller to callee in a network call (e.g. through HTTP headers). Each stage is represented with a span containing the ID.
- When a span ends, it's emitted to a collector services that assembles it into a trace by stiching it to all the other spans belonging to the same trace.
- Difficult to retrofit into an existing system.
