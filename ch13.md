## Chapter 13. Asynchronous transactions
- 2PC is a synchronous blocking protol as the coordinator needs to wait for replies from all participants.
  - It is generally combined with a blocking concurrency control protocol like 2PL to provide isolation.

### 13.1 Outbox pattern
- The outbox pattern is when services communicate via persistent messages.
- An outbox table is maintained by the local service that keeps track of the messages that it has sent out.
  - Since the database most likely will support ACID, the message is appended to the table if and only if the local transaction is not aborted and committed.
  - A dedicated relay service can also monitor the table. It sends out the message when it detects a new one, or deletes the message when receipient acknowledges that the message has been received.
  - An idempotency key is used to ensure the message is only processed once.
  - In practice, the relay process forwards the messages to a message channel like Kaka or Azure Event Hubs that are responsible for delivering them to the destinations in the same order as they were appended.

### 13.2 Sagas
- The Saga pattern can be used when transactions are distributed across different services. A saga is a distributed transaction that consists of a set of local transactions (T_1, T_2, ..., T_i) where each T_i has a corresponding compensating local transaction C_i that is used to undo its changes.
- The saga guarantees that either all local transactions succeed, or in case of failure, the compensating local transactions will undo the changes altogether.
  - This provides atomicity as either all local transactions succeed, or none of them do.
- An orchestrator, the transaction coordinator, manages the execution of the local transactions across all the participants involved.
  - The coordinator initiates the transaction by sending a request to service A
    - If it fails, the coordinator marks the transaction as aborted and no harm is done
  - If it succeeds, it sends another request to Service B
    - If it succeeds, the transaction is marked as successful
  - If it fails, the coordinator sends a undo request to service A to undo the changes made locally
- The coordinator can communicate with participants asynchronously via message channels to tolerate temporary failures.
- The state of transaction needs to be persisted since the coordinator could fail. It can resume where it left off on restart by checking the last checkpoint.
- If the coordinator crashes after sending a request but befoer backing up its state, it will send the request again.
  - All participants need to de-duplicate the messages they receive to make them idempotent.
- Cloud services like Aws Step Functions, Azure Durable Functions help to manage such workflows.

### 13.3 Isolation
- Semantic locks: any data that saga modifies is marked with a dirty flag, which is only cleared at the end of the transaction.
- Another transaction trying to access a dirty record can either fail and rollback its changes, or wait until the flag is cleared.
