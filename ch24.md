## 24. Common failure causes
- A system has a failure when it can no longer provides its services as per specification.
- Fault occurs when an internal or external dependency fails.

### 24.1  Hardware faults
- Any physical part of a machine could fail.

### 24.2 Incorrect error handling
- Incorrect handling of non-fatal errors is one of the common leading causes of catastrophic system failures.

### 24.3 Configuration changes
- Configuration updates are also one of the common causes for catastrophic failures.
- Configuration changes are dangerous because their effects can be delayed, and thus making them harder to detect.
- Configuration changes should be version-controlled and tested.

### 24.4 Single point of failure
- A single point of failure occurs when a component fails and brings down the whole system with it.
- Automation should be leveraged as much as possible to avoid human errors.
- If redundancy is not an option, then we should aim to reduce the SPOF's blast radius on the system when it fails.

### 24.5 Network faults
- Slow network calls could lead to system failures, since the clients would not know when the response will eventually arrive.
- Grey failure: a subtle failure that cannot be detected quickly or accurately.

### 24.6 Resource leaks
- A memory leak causes a study increase in memory consumption over time.
- A thread may not be returned to a threadpool if it blocks on a synchronous request without timeout.
  - Modern HTTP clients use socket pools to avoid recreating TCP connections. If the connection is never returned, then eventually there won't be any connections available.

### 24.7 Load pressure
- Every system has a limit of how much load it can withstand.
- Automation can help with organic increase in load, whereas unexpected ones like malicious ones should be rejected.

### 24.8 Cascading failures
- It's possible for a small failure to cascade, leading to a bigger system failure.
  - For example, given replica A and B, A goes down, and all requests are forwarded to B. B is overwelmed. A comes back up. Cycle repeats.
- Traffic should be temporarily blocked to break up the loop.

### 24.9 Managing risk
- A fault that is highly likely to occur and has a large impact should be prioritized for resolution.
