## Manageability
- Configuration should be persisted in a dedicated store (AWS App Config or Azure App Config).
- At deployment time, the CD pipeline read the configuration from the store and pass it the application through environment variables.
  - Drawback: configuration cannot be changed without redeployment.
- Application can periodically re-read configuration during run time and apply the changes.
