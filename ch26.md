## 26. Fault isolation
- Redundancy would not help with highly correlated failures (e.g. bug in the code or malicious request)
  - Bulkhead pattern: to reduce blast radius of malicious requests/noisy neighbours, the application stack can be partitioned based on the user that is making the request.

### 26.1 Shuffle sharding
- For stateless service, virtual partitioning can be used reduce the likelihood of two users being allocated to the same partition.
  - Composed of random (but permanent) subsets of service instances.

### 26.2 Cellular architecture
- The entire application stack (including load balancers, compute services, storage services) can be partitioned by user into cells.
- Each cell is independent of each other and the gateway service is responsible for routing requests to the right cells.
- When the system needs to scale out, a new cell is added rather than scaling out existing ones.
