## 29. Testing

### 29.1 Scope
- SUT stands for the scope of the test.
- Unit tests should:
  - Use only the public interface
  - Test for state changes (instead of sequence of actions)
  - Test for behaviours
- Integration tests:
  - Narrow integration tests: exercises only the code paths of a service that communicate with a specific external dependency.
  - Broad integration tests: exercises code paths across multiple live services.
- End-to-end test: validates behaviours that span multiple services in the system.
- User journey tests: simulates multi-step interaction of a user with the system. Used to minimize end-to-end tests.
- General rule of thumb: large number of unit tests, small fraction of integrations, and even fewer end-to-end tests.

### 29.2 Size
- A small test is fast as it runs in a single process and doesn't perform blocking calls.
- An intermediate test performs local I/O like reads from disk or network calls to localhost. As a result, it introduces non-determinism and increases the likelihood of intermittent failures.
- A large test requires multiple nodes to run, introducing even more non-determinism and longer delays.
- Test doubles could be used instead of real dependencies.
  - Fake: lightweight implementation of an interface similar to the real one.
  - Stub: always return the same value no matter what is passed.
  - Mock: test interactions based on expecations on how it should be called.
- Contract test: defines a request for an external dependency with the corresponding expected response.

### 29.3 Practical considerations
- Minimize the use of test doubles as they do not resemble real implementations.
- Use in-memory implementation to avoid issuing network calls.

### 29.4 Formal vertification
- Writing specification using formal language allows us verify algorithmically it (model checking).
- TLA/TLA+ are well known formal specification languages.
  - In TLA+, system behaviours are described using sequence of states, which are assignments of global variables.
    - Safety property: something is true for all states of a behaviour (invariant).
    - Liveness property: asserts that something eventually happens.
