## 23. Messaging
- A message channel can be used as a buffer between the sender and the receiver.
- Messaging is inherently asynchronous since sending a message does not require the receiver to be online.
- Requests can be load-balanced across a pool of consumer instances.
- Enables multiple messages to be processed within a single batch or unit of work.
  - Requests batching improves throughput (resource utilization) at the cost of processing latency.
- In a point-to-point channel, a message is delivered to exactly one consumer.
- In a publish-subscribe channel, each consumer receives a copy of the message.
- One-way messaging: the producer sends a message to a point-to-point channel with the assumption that the message will be processed by a consumer eventually.
- Request-response messaging: in addition to the direct request-response style, the consumer has a point-to-point request channel for reading messages, and every producer has its dedicated response channel.
  - The producer decorates the message with a request ID which is then used by the consumer to indicate which response channel the message should be written to.
- Broadcast messaging: a message is written to a publish-subscribe channel in which the message would be broadcast to all the consumers.


### 23.1 Guarantees
- AWS SQS or Kafka are examples of a messaging service.
- Strong ordering guarantees are typically not guaranteed by messaging services. This is because the service needs to be scaled out horizontally, in which data could be stored in different nodes. Coordination is then required to support ordering guarantees.
  - Kafka: partitions a channel into sub-channels, a message is added to a specific sub channel based on the partition key. It provides odering gurantees to ensuring that only one consumer group can read the partition at any given time.
- Caveat: a partition can become hot and the consumer reading from it cannoot keep up with the load. As such, rebalancing might be occur. During this time, the performance of the broker might degrade as messages have to be shuffled across the new partitions.
- Some additional tradeoffs different message brokers might make:
  - Delivery guarantees (at-most-once or at-least-once)
  - Durability guarantees
  - Latency
  - Competing consumer instances
  - Limits (like size of messages)
- Visibility timeout: how long does it take a message to reappear in the channel if it cannot be processed (when the original consumer processing it timeouts or crashes).

### 23.2 Exactly-once processing
- It's impossible to have exactly-once delivery.
  - Consumer deletes the message before processing it.
  - Consumer processes the message then crashes before deleting it.
  - As such, we opt for idempotence instead to prevent a message from being processed more than once.

### 23.3 Failures
- To prevent a message being picked up in perpetuity, a limit is set on the number of times a message can be read from the channel.
- To prevent data loss, a message could be put into a dead-letter channel if the limit is reached.

### 23.4 Backlogs
- A backlog builds up when the consume cannot keep up with the producer.
- A messaging channel introduces a bimodal behavuour: either there is no backlog, or there is a backlog that degrades the system.
- A backlog can be detected by measuring the throughput of the channel (i.e. the average the time a message waits in the channel to be read for the first time).

### 23.5 Fault isolation
- A producer is "poisonous" if the messages it produces will repeatedly fail to be processed.
- The consumer can identify such producers and forward their messages to a low priority channel.
