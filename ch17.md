## 17. File storage
- Cloud services like AWS S3 or Azure Blob Storage can be used to store large static files.
  
### 17.1 Blob storage architecture
- Blob store architecture (Azure Storage/AS as an example)
  - AS is composed of storage clusters distributed across multiple regions.
  - A storage cluster is composed of multiple racks of nodes.
  - Each rack is built out as a separate unit with redundant networking and power.
- AS exposes a global namespace based on two main parts: account name and file name.
- Account name is specified by the client, and it is used by the AS DNS server to identify the corresponding storage cluster.
- The storage cluster then uses the filename to locate the node responsible for the data.
- A central location service (global control plane) is responsible for creating new accounts and allocate them to the storage clusters.
  - It may also move accounts to different clusters for better load distribution.
- A storage cluster is composed of: a stream layer, a partition layer, and a front-end layer.
  - Stream layer: implements a distributed append-only file system.
    - Data is stored in streams, and a stream is represented as a sequence of extents
    - extent is the unit of replication. Writes to extents are replicated synchronously using chain replication.
    - Stream manager: responsible for assigning an extent to a chain of storage servers in the cluster.
      - when asked to allocate a new extent, it responds a list of storage servers that hold a copy of the newly created extent.
      - clients cache this information for future writes.
  - Partition layer: where high-level file operations are translated to low-level stream operations.
    - Partition manager: manages a large index of all files stored in the cluster.
      - Each entry contains metadata (e.g. account name, filename, and a pointer to the actual data in the stream service).
      - It range partitions the index and maps each partition to a partition server.
      - It load balances partitions across servers.
      - It replicates accounts accross clusters in the background.
  - Front-end: a stateless service that authenticates requests and routes them to the appropriate partition server using the mapping managed by the partition manager.
    - Reads and writes are handled by the partition server.
