## 19. Data storage

### 19.1 Replication
- Leader-follower topology: writes are exclusively sent to the leader (where changes are persisted in the write-ahead log). Replicas connect to the leader and stream log entries from it and commit them locally.
  - The replication can be synchronous or asynchronous.
  - Aynchronous: the leader broadcasts the updates to its followers and responds to the clients immediatel without waiting for the acknowledge from the followers.
    - Not fault tolerant because the leader can crash after acknowledging a write but before the write is broadcasted, leading to data loss.
  - Synchronous: the leader waits for the write to be acknowledged by the followers before returning a response to the client. As a result, occurs a performance penalty.
  - In PostgreSQL, individual followers can be configured to received updates synchronously. We can set up a follower to have an up-to-date back-up of of the leader (to use it as a failover).
  - AWS RDS/Azure SQL Database supporst read replicas and automated failover out of the box.
  - Replication only scale out reads but not writes.

### 19.2 Partitioning
- Partioning generally are not supported out-of-the-box, and it is usually implemented on the aplication layer.
  - Relational databases designed in an era where disk space was costly.
- Additional complexities:
  - How to partition the data and do rebalancing (when a partition becomes too hot or too big)
  - Since data is partitioned, responses have to be combined from different sub-queries (aggregrations/joins).
  - Need to support atomic transactions across partitions (2PC).

### 19.3 NoSQL
- White papers such as Bigtable and Dynamo revolutionized the industry and pushed toward scalable storage layer.
- NoSQL embraces relaxed consistency models such as eventual and causal consistency for high availability.
- Generally do not support joins nor transactions since the data is typically stoerd in unnormalized form anyway.
  - Stores are generally not relational.
- Data is represented as key-value pairs or documents that are unnormalized.
- When using NoSQL data store, it's important to determine the access patterns upfront.
  - Amazon DynamoDB: table contains items, each item may have different attributes, but it must be uniquely identified by a primary key.
    - The primary key can either be a stand-alone partition key (dictates how the item is partitioned), or combined with the sort key (how the item is ordered within the partition).
    - Writes are routed to the leader, and an acknowldegement is sent to the client when W out of N replicas have received the write.
    - Entities of different types can be stored into the same table (like `customer` and `orders`).
    - Local secondary indexes: allow for alternate sort keys in the same table.
    - Gloal secondary indexes: allow for alternative partition and sort keys, with the caveat that index updates are asynchronous and eventually consistent.
  - Common misconception: NoSQL are more flexible, but in practice, a lot of attention is required on how the data is modeled when using NoSQL (coupled to the access patterns).
- NewSQL: combine the scalability of NoSQL with ACID guarantees of relational databases.
  - Prefers consistency as it argues that using the right decision, the reduction in availability caused by enforcing strong consistency is hardly noticeable for most applications.
    - 100% availability is not possible anyway.
  - Examples: CockroaddB and Spanner.
