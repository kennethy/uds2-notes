## 14 HTTP caching
- Static resource that doesn't change often should be cached to reduce the response time and the load on the server.
- HTTP caching is limited to safe request methods that do not modify the server's state, like `GET` or `HEAD`.
- Specific HTTP headers can be used to determine if the resource is cachable.
  - `TTL` that determines the time-to-live duration
  - `ETag` header with a version identififer for the resource
- If the resource has expired, it is considered stale.
  - The client could send a `GET` request to the server with a conditional `If-None-Match` header.
  - The server replies with a `304 Not Modified` if the resource has not been updated.
- A static resource should be immutable so the clients can cache it forever.
  - A new URL can be used for a static resource that has been updated. This forces the client to get the latest resource.
- Read paths are typically accessed multiple orders of magnitude higher than write paths.

### 14.1 Reverse proxies
- Reverse proxy is server-side proxy that intercepts all communications with clients. The clients are unaware of this intermediary.
- It is typically used to cache static resources returned by the server.
- Some additional use cases:
  - to authenticate requests
  - to compress a response
  - rate-limiting
  - load balance requests
- NGINX and HAProxy are widely used to build server-side cache.
