## 30. Continuous delivery and deployment
- There is a tradeoff between the safety of a rollout and the time it takes to release a change to production.

### 30.1 Review and build
- Main stages:
  - Review
  - Build
  - Pre-production rollout
  - Production rollout
- Infrastructure dependencies should be declared as code so that they can be version controlled and verified.

### 30.2 Pre-production
- Artifact is released to a synthetic pre-production environment.
- CD pipeline should ideally assess the artifact's health using the same signals in production (to avoid former being a second-class citizen).

### 30.3 Production
- During rollout, a fraction of the fleet can't serve any traffic, and thus the remaining instances might be under-stress as they need to pick up the slack.
- Start with a low-traffic region to reduce mitigate potential impact.

### 30.4 Rollback
- In addition to health signals of the service being rolled out, the CD pipeline should also monitor the health of upstream and downstream services to detect impact.
- The pipeline should allow some time to pass (bake time) to ensure the rollout is successful.
  - could gate the number of requests seen for a specific API endpoint to ensure the API surface has been properly exercised.
- Change should ideally be backward compatible to allow safe rollbacks.
  - Prepare change: consumer modified to support both new and the old format.
  - Activate change: producer is modified for the new format.
  - Clean up: consumer stops supporting the old format.
