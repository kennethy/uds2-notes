## Chapter 10. Replication
- Raft's replication algorithm provides strong consistency, the strongest kind of guarantee possible with the cost of latency.
  - Based on state machine replication, in which the leader broadcasts operations that change its state to the followers (replicas).
  - Due to the nature of network, it's possible for messages to be lost, and thus a large part of the algorithm is dedicated for fault tolerance.
  - Each process is modeled as a state machine that transitions from one state to another given an input. As the input are processed in the same order, the state of the process will be determinstic.
  
### 10.1 State machine replication
- Upon system startup, a leader is chosen using Raft's leader election algorithm. Only the leader can change the replicated state by storing the sequence of operations into a local log.
- The local log is an ordered list of entries that replicated to the followers to sync states across all processes.
- The entries include:
  - a determinsitic operation that will be applied to the state.
  - the index of the entry's position in the log
  - the leader's election term
-  A leader appends a new entry to its log when it wants to apply for the corresponding operation.
-  The leader sends `AppendEntries` request to all replicas with the new entry to be added.
-  The request is periodically sent-out as a heartbeart (to notify all replicas about the health of the leader).
-  Upon receiving the request, the replica appends the received entries to its log, and notifies the leader. It does not apply the operation to its local state yet.
-  The entries are considered committed when the leader hears back from a majority of its followers.
-  The leader keeps track of the higest committed index in the log, which is sent in all future `AppendEntries` request.
-  A replica only applies a log entry to its local state when it finds out the leader has committed the entry.
- The leader can make progress even if some are down (as it only requires a majority/quorum).
- The algorithm provides the guarantee that entries that are committed are durable and will be eventually executed by all the processes in the system, not just those that were part of the marjority.
- Only a process that has the most committed entries can be elected as a leader. This is done by comparing the index of the last entries between the processes. 
  - If the logs end with different terms, the process that has the higher term is more up-to-date.
  - When the terms are equal, the process that has a longer log is more up-to-date.
- If `AppendEntries` request cannot be sent to one ore more followers, the leader will indefinitely try to send them again until a majority of the replicas have successfully appended it to their logs.
  - `AppendEntries` requests are idempotent and thus save to retry.
- When a replica comes back online, it will reject the `AppendEntries` request if it cannot find a log entry with the index and term that immediately precedes the one to be appended. This is to prevent a gap in its log. The preceding (index, term) is also included in the request.
- When a `AppendEntries` request is rejected, the leader retries the request to the same replica until the corresponmding (index, term) is found.

### 10.2 Consensus
- Consensus: when a group of processes has to decide a value such that:
  - every non-faulty process eventually agree on a value
  - the final decision of every non-faulty process is the same everywhere
  - the valyue that has been agreed on has been proposed by a process.
  - Consensus provides the API of a write-once register: a thread-safe and linerizable register that can onl be written once but can be read many times.

### 10.3 Consistent models
- Reads do not necessarily have to go through the leader. Replicas can also serve reads.
- There is a tradeoff between how consistent the observers' views of the system are and the system's performance and availability.
- Consistency models help to define the possible views the observers can have of the system's state.

### 10.3.1 Strong consistency
- Linearizability, or strong consistency, is the strongest consistency guarantee a system can provide for single-object requests.
- Leader can't serve reads directly since it may no longer be the leader after receiving a request from the client.
- The presumed leader needs to a majority of the replicas to confirm whether it still is the leader, before it is allowed to execute a request.
  - Otherwise, it transitions into the replica state and fails the request.
  - The confirmation time increases the time required to serve a read.
  
### 10.3.2 Sequential consistency
- Sequential consistency ensures operations occur in the asme order for all observers, but doesn't guarantee when the side effects of the operation become visible.
- A producer/consumer system synchronized with a queue is an example of this model.

### 10.3.3 Eventual consistency
- Eventual consistency provides the guarantee that all replicas will eventually converge to the final state if writes to the system stop.

### 10.3.4 The CAP theorem
- CAP Theorem: strong consistency, availability, and partition tolerance: pick two of three.
- Since partition tolerance is required, the choice is really between strong consistency or availability.
- In real system, perfect availability is impossible. A more realistic approach is to view consistency and availability as a spectrum.
- PACELC Theorem: in the absence of network partition (P), one has to choose between availability (A) and consistency (C), else (E), one has to choose between latency (L) and consistency (C).
  - Implies a tradeoff between performance and the amount of coordination required.

### 10.4 Chain replication
- Processes are arranged in a chain.
- Head of the chain receives writes and they are propagated through the chain all the way to the tail. Once the write is handled by the tail, it sends an acknowledgement through the chain again all the way back to the head.
- Reads are served by the tail.
- Fault tolerance is delegated to a separate component (the control plane).
  - It monitors the chain's health and removes faulty processes in the chain.
  - It requires state machine replication as it needs to be fault tolerant.
  - The chain can tolerate N-1 processes failing, where N is the length of the chain, whereas the control plane can only tolerate C/2 failures where C is the number of replicas that make up the control plane.
- Failure modes:
  - If the head committed to a write to its local state before forwarding it downstream, no harm is done since the write hasn't been propagated through the chain.
  - If the tail fails, the predecessor will be picked as the new tail by the control plane. The predecessor must have received all the updates.
  - If an intermediate process X fails, the X's successor will communicate with the control plane.
    - X's successor lets the control plane know the last committed update it has seen, and get the control plane to instruct X's predecessor to send the missing updates downstream.
- Problems:
  - A single slow replica can slow down all writes.
  - Wrties cannot be committed until the control plane discovers the fault.
- Chain replication can guarantee linearizability
  - All replicas to store multiple versions of an object, each including a version number and a dirty flag.
  - Replicas mark an update as dirty as it propagates from head to the tail.
  - When a replica receives an acknowledgement, it marks the corresponding version as clean.
  - On read, it is served immediately if the latest version is clean. If not, it contacts the tail for the last committed version.
- Chain replication reduces the amount of coordination needed for each client request.
